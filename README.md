### Features: 

Twenty five colorful balls travel at different speeds and bounce off the walls of the display. When a ball is clicked on, a chain reaction occurs, with said ball increasing size before decreasing and disappearing. Other balls that come into contact with said ball also repeat the same actions. This chain reaction can only be initiated once, and further clicks by user will produce no reaction.
